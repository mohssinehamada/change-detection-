### Summary

Here, we try to train from scatch a simple siamese network on google colab for 100 epochs with the model comprising pre-trained VGG-16 and other convolutional layers. This is to compare how well this model can perform compared to SarasNET or other state-of-the-art change detection models on Levir-CD dataset
